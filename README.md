# S.T.A.R.
The Short-term Aerial Reconnaissance Drone (STAR) is a senior design project from the University of Arizona, completed in May 2024 with sponsorship from Raytheon.

The project's objective was to develop an affordable, remote-controlled surveillance drone that could be launched from a 40mm tube. The project also had strict requirements for flight time, range, deployment time, weight, image quality, and many others, that added to its complexity.

This team successfully met and exceeded all mission requirements set by Raytheon during a series of tests in Red Rock, Arizona, on April 21, 2024. During these tests, a STAR drone was successfully launched from a 40mm pneumatic launcher, deployed at an altitude of over 100 meters, and flew under its own power while transmitting live video back to its operators.
This project won an award for the best UAS system.

The team, pictured from left to right, consisted of five members: Nathan Julicher (Mechanical Engineering), Thomas Schwab (Computer Engineering), Chuy Talavera (Mechanical Engineering), Max Ybarra (Mechanical Engineering), and Jason Li (Systems Engineering).
